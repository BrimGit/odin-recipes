    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Indian prawn curry. Unbelievably easy to make and lip-smacking, this prawn curry is one of my all-time favorites. The aromatic spices give it a wonderful flavor, and the prawns are cooked to perfection in the delicious sauce. Spoon this fragrant curry over a bed of fluffy rice or pair it with your favorite classic flatbread for an effortless meal that’s made for cooler months.</p>

        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a medium pan with salted water, place over a high heat and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Peel and finely slice the garlic and onion, then peel and finely grate the ginger. Halve and deseed the chilli, then finely slice. Roughly chop the tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Add the rice to the boiling water and cook for 10 minutes, or until tender. Drain in a sieve, then return to the warm pan, cover with a lid and set aside off the heat.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a medium pan over a medium heat, add the mustard seeds, garam masala and turmeric, then fry for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add the onion, garlic and ginger, then fry for 10 minutes, or until softened. Add the chilli, tomatoes and a splash of water, then turn the heat up and cook for a further 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Next, add the prawns and coconut milk, bring to the boil then reduce the heat slightly and simmer gently for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the prawns are just cooked.</li>
        <li>Stir through the spinach and cook for a further 1 to 2 minutes until the spinach has wilted.</li>
        <li>Divide the rice between plates. Season the prawn curry to taste with salt, black pepper and a squeeze of lime juice, then ladle the curry onto the rice. Serve with the remaining lime, cut into wedges for squeezing over.</li>
